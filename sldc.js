const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the end goal, what needs to happent in order to create this project, whats the requirements, what do we need to do to get there."

const design = "Lets design out the big picture view of the code itself, lets design out structure of the code."

const implementation = "This is actually writing the code and implementing it, getting it down and making sure it runs."

const testing&Integration = "Companies have a quality assurance department and they will go through and run tests on the code to make sure that it meets requirements, that it is doing what it needs to do.

const maintain = "Doing regualar maintenance on the code, updating it, making sure that it gets to the customer the way it should, that its working for customers the way it should and debugging things that are introduced along the way."
